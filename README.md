This repository contains an implementation of Perceptron Algorithm using Python.

## Overview

In this repository, we demonstrate how to perform perceptron algorithm using Python. We utilize libraries such as NumPy and pandas to implement the model. Additionally, we provide a simple example along with explanations to help you understand how to apply perceptron algorithm to your own datasets.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas  

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Perceptron-Algorithm.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd PerceptronAlgorithm
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `PerceptronAlgorithm.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how perceptron algorithm is implemented using Python.
